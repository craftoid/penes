Penes
=====

**A Processing Library for Genetic Algorithms based on Jenes**  

**Pronounciation**: Like **Genes** but with a capital **P**  
**License**: Both Jenes and Penes are licensed under *GPL 3.0*

## Development

This library is pretty much in pre-alpha state.  
I'm currently turning the examples into Processing Sketches.   
In the next step I'll create a more Processing-like Wrapper
and rewrite the examples.

### Done

* Tutorial 1 has been turned into a Processing Sketch

### Todo

* Add more Tutorials
* Create Processing Wrapper
